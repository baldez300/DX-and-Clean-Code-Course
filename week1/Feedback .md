# Title: Feedback on UI Design and Code Structure

## Issue Description:

I've reviewed the codebase, specifically focusing on the UI design, and I'd like to share some thoughts and concerns. It's essential to ensure that the UI design and the underlying code work together seamlessly and efficiently to provide an optimal user experience.

## UI Design and Communication:
One key aspect of UI design is its ability to communicate the purpose and functionality of the application. In this code, the UI design uses consistent fonts, colors, and layout techniques. These choices contribute to a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. However, I recommend that the code should include more comments or documentation to explain why certain design choices were made. This can help new team members understand the rationale behind the design, making it easier to maintain and improve in the future.

## Complexity and Database Structure:
While the UI design appears visually appealing, it's important to consider whether it has led to unnecessary complexity in the codebase. In general, it's essential to maintain a balance between aesthetics and simplicity. To determine if the UI design has introduced excessive complexity, a deeper code review may be required.
