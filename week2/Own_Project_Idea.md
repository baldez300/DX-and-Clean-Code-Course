# Project Proposal for the Remaining Six Weeks

I'd like to propose a project idea for the remaining six weeks that's manageable yet has enough depth to explore various aspects of software development, including design, architecture, and implementation. I'm open to feedback and adjustment based on your preferences and the course's objectives.

## Project Idea: Task Management Web Application

### Overview

The project involves developing a web application for task management. The application will allow users to create, manage, and track tasks or to-do lists. It will focus on providing a user-friendly interface and an organized way of handling tasks.

### Key Features

1. **User Registration and Authentication:**
   - Users can register with the application and log in.
   - Authentication mechanisms should be in place to protect user data.

2. **Task Management:**
   - Users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
   - Tasks have attributes like title, description, due date, priority, and status.
   - Users can categorize tasks into different lists or categories.

3. **Task Tracking:**
   - Users can mark tasks as completed and filter tasks based on their status.
   - Users can set due dates and receive reminders for upcoming tasks.
   - Task history and completion statistics can be displayed.

4. **User Collaboration (Optional for now):**
   - Users can share tasks or lists with others for collaborative work.
   - Implement user permissions and access control for shared tasks.

5. **Clean Code and Modular Structure:**
   - Emphasize clean code principles to make the codebase maintainable.
   - Implement a modular structure for the application.

### Technology Stack

- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or a modern JavaScript framework like React)
- **Back-end:** Python with a web framework (e.g., Flask or Django)
- **Database:** SQL database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL)

### Progression

The project can be developed incrementally, starting with user registration and task management, and gradually adding features like task tracking and user collaboration. This approach allows for feature-by-feature development and testing.

### Why This Project

- It provides a practical example of building a web application with user registration and authentication.
- It covers both front-end and back-end development aspects.
- The project can be expanded with new features or refinements as needed.
- It aligns well with the goal of creating a well-structured codebase.

I believe this project provides a manageable scope with room for depth and growth. However, I'm open to your feedback and guidance regarding its size and any adjustments you'd like to make.

## The app name is:
Task Manager Pro or Task Hub Pro or Task Master Pro
